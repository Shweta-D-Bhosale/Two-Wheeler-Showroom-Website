<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">

The scooter gets telescopic forks up front and a monoshock at the rear to handle suspension duties. The scooter is a decent handler but a slightly firmer front suspension could have been firmer like the rear side. Stopping power is derived from drum brakes at the front and at the rear. The scooter misses out on disc brakes though, even as an option. Plus, Yamaha scooters do not get additional braking assistance in terms of ABS (anti-lock brakes) or something like the Combi-braking system that is offered on other scooters in India.</p>
