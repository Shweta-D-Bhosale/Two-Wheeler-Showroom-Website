<h1>Information</h1>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
The Access 125 has been the most successful product for Suzuki in the Indian market. Since its introduction in 2007, it has been a money-spinner for the company.
 The reason being, it offered the right amount of value for the money and in fact, it was priced on par with certain 110cc scooters.
 However, after the launch of the Honda Activa 125 in 2014, the sales of Access 125 started to drop,
 calling for a much needed upgrade and now we’ve one in 2016 and it’s more than just a cosmetic update.
 So does the new Access 125 have what it takes to command the numero uno position in the 125cc segment once again? Here’s what a spin on the scooter told us.</p>

<h1>Main Information</h1>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
The Suzuki Access 125 is the flagship commuter model in the company’s scooter lineup. Apart from revising the chassis and powertrain, Suzuki has retained the universally appealing but slightly bland looks for the Access.

The front of the new Suzuki Access 125 gets a new fascia thanks to the redesigned apron and headlamp, while the side profile gets curvy body panels to match its retro character. The subtle touches of chrome on the headlamp and the exhaust shield give it a premium feel. The Access 125 has a contactless switch for the starter and a 12V DC power socket as an optional accessory.

Powering the Suzuki Access 125 is a 125cc single-cylinder engine which delivers 8.6bhp and 10.2Nm of torque, through a CVT transmission. 

The Suzuki Access 125 is available in four variants, three of which involve variations with the brakes. You can have drum brakes, drum brakes with CBS, or a front disc brake with CBS. The fourth variant is a ‘Special Edition’ which is a cosmetic upgrade of the sole disc brake variant.  While the disc brake variants get alloy wheels, the drum brake customers have to make do with steel wheels. It is offered in five colours – red, black, silver, white and grey. The Access 125 is also available in a special edition version, with decals and a maroon seat and chrome round mirrors that lend it a retro look. The Access 125 competes with the Honda Activa 125, TVS Ntorq and Aprilia SR 125.</p> 

<h1>Suzuki Access 125 Mileage</h1>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
Suzuki Access 125 delivers fuel efficiency number near 45kmpl. This is a lesser number compared to the competition but the performance is commendable from its engine. Progress made by this scooter is rapid which takes some toll on fuel efficiency, but then its performance with two people onboard is impressive enough to overlook lesser mileage</p>
<h1>Suzuki Access 125 Performance and Handling</h1>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
As evident performance from the 8.5bhp engine is more than satisfying. It is quick and builds up speed in a smooth and refined manner. Suspension sprung is not too soft or too hard, its in the middle with some bias towards stiff. This makes for stable cornering but slightly hard for regular use. Also, rough patches can be felt through the saddle, but good seat cushioning takes up most of the beating. </p>

<h1>Suzuki Access 125 Looks</h1>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
The Suzuki Access 125 scooter gets a retro-design with a rectangular headlamp having a chrome surround which adds to the premium-ness of the scooter. While the front end is not exactly stylish, the apron is flanked by two longish indicators which are the only styling bits up front on the Access 125. Viewed from the side, the panels on the scooter are plain. There is a patch of grey plastic, which adds to the styling, although not exactly adding to the looks. From the rear, the Access 125 looks decent, with a big tail lamp and the chrome cover on the muffler takes the style quotient a few notches higher. Overall, it is yet to catch up as far as design is concerned, with other 125 cc scooters such as the TVS NTorq 125 and the Aprilia SR 125.  Do read our Access 125 review on carandbike.com.</p>
