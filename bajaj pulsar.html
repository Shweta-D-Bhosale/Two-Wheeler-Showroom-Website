<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bajaj Pulsar is a motorcycle brand owned by Bajaj Auto in India. 
The two wheeler was developed by the product engineering division of Bajaj Auto in association with
 Tokyo R&D, and later with motorcycle designer Glynn Kerr. Currently there are six variants available,
 with engine capacities of 135 cc, 150 cc, 180 cc, 200 cc, 220 cc and 400 cc (Renamed Dominar before
 release). Earlier it was also offered with a 200 cc DTS-i oil cooled engine, which now has been 
 discontinued. Instead a new version Pulsar 200NS was launched in 2009. However Pulsar 200NS production
 was discontinued in August 2015 (reintroduced in early 2017 with BS IV Emission compliance and renamed
 the NS200).With average monthly sales of around 86,000 units in 2011, Pulsar claimed a 2011 market share of 47% in its segment.
 By April 2012, more than five million units of Pulsar were sold. </font></p>
 <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">Before the introduction of the Pulsar, the Indian motorcycle market trend was towards fuel efficient, small capacity motorcycles (that formed the 80–125 cc class). Bigger motorcycles with higher capacity virtually did not exist (except for Enfield Bullet with 350cc and 500cc variants). The launch and success of Hero Honda CBZ in 1999 showed that there was demand for performance bikes. Bajaj took the cue from there on and launched the Pulsar twins (150cc and 180cc) in India on 24 November 2001.[5] Since the introduction and success of Bajaj Pulsar, Indian youth began expecting high power and other features from affordable motorcycles.
The project faced internal resistance, reservations by McKinsey & Company and doubts on its effects on Bajaj's relation with Kawasaki. The project took approximately 36 months for completion and cost Bajaj ₹ 1 billion.

<h1>History</h1>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The original Pulsar came with a 150 cc air-cooled, single-cylinder, petrol, spark-ignited four-stroke engine which made 11.8 HP of maximum power. It featured a single spark plug to ignite the air-fuel mixture fed from a carburetor, simple spring shock absorbers, round headlamp dome and 1,265 mm wheelbase. Disc brakes as standard equipment was a novelty in Indian motorcycles of the early 2000s. Other standard features were parking lights and an aircraft-type fuel tank lid.
In mid-2001, the Indian Army ordered 1500 Bajaj Pulsars for its defense personnel.
The 180 cc version made 15 HP of maximum power and came with a twin-tone horn, which was optional equipment on the 150 cc version. Electric Start (ES) was offered as standard feature in the 180 cc model and optional on the 150 cc model.<br><br>
</font></p>
<h2>2003</h2><br>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">The second generation Pulsars featured Bajaj Auto's newly developed DTSi technology, which increased the power rating of both versions by 1 hp (0.75 kW) each and also increased fuel economy.This model also introduced a new headlamp assembly, 1,320 mm wheelbase,[18]and standard twin-tone horn and trip meter.
</font></p>
<h2>2005</h2><br>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">In 2005, Bajaj launched Pulsar 150. The bike was offered with 17-inch (430 mm) alloy wheels as standard option, and the stance was also lowered by about 12 mm. It was the first time any bike maker in India had offered 17-inch (430 mm) profile wheels at the rear. The fuel tank now had a capacity of only 18 litres.[19] The power output was now further increased to 13.5 hp (10.1 kW) @ 8500 rpm for the 150 while it increased to 16.5 hp (12.3 kW) @ 8500 rpm for the 180.The rear shock absorbers were now gas-filled Nitrox absorbers.
</font></p>
<h2>2006</h2><br>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
Bajaj introduced another version of Pulsar (UG III). New features included: pilot lamps separated from the main headlamp, turn indicators with clear lenses and amber bulb, self-cancelling turn indicator switch, flush LCD screen with digital read-out of key vehicle data, non-contact speed sensor, non-contact backlit switches, twin-stripe LED tail-light assembly and side panels altered for a sharp, tapering-towards-the-rear look. The engine had increased torque availability, reduced vibration and improved gear shift feel.

<h1>4 types of Bajaj Pulsar motorcycles for 4 kinds of buyers:</h1><h1><n>Who should buy what?</h1>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
Bajaj first launched the Pulsar in 2001 in two variants, a 150 cc bike and a 180 cc bike. From then to nearly 18 years now, the Pulsar range has proved to be the bestselling motorcycle for the company. It provided India with a more sporty and upmarket alternative of commuting during a time when Indian moto scene had gone bland. Currently, the name Pulsar is associated with a number of bikes, ranging from 135 cc engine capacity to 220 cc engine capacity. If you are planning to get one soon, here is a list of 6 different types of Pulsars for six types of Indian riders.
</font></p>
<b>For the budget conscious rider looking for a good-looking ride and mileage – 135 LS</b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
If you want to get a Pulsar but are short on budget, the Pulsar 135 LS is the bike for you. Not only is it affordable with prices starting at Rs 64,141, ex-showroom (Delhi), it also returns a good mileage of 64 kmpl. This makes both purchasing and running affordable. The Pulsar 135 LS is the most affordable and frugal bike in the Pulsar range but does not fall short on style and substance. Newbie riders will also appreciate its nimbleness and find it easy to ride.

<b>For the safe rider – Pulsar 150 Twin Disc</b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
The Pulsar 150 is among the cheapest bikes in India to come with an option of disk brakes at both the ends. If you prioritize safety but are a bit tight on budget, the Pulsar 150 Twin Disc can be yours at just Rs. 79,514. It gets a 260 mm front disc and a 230 mm rear disc brake which will provide enough bite to bring your bike to a stop compared to other bikes.

<b>For the speed freak wanting a faired bike at the right price – Pulsar RS200</b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
The RS200 was Bajaj’s most powerful bike in India before the arrival of the Dominar. The RS200 looks quite good because of its stylish full fairing and is among the cheapest fully faired bikes in India, starting at just Rs. 1.27 lakhs. It not only looks good but has power to match, with 24.5 bhp on tap. This enables it to reach 140+km/h top speed which is quite good, if not the best. The RS200 also has a ABS variant on offer but it comes at an extra premium.
</font></p>
<img src="bajaj pulsar\11.jpg"height="50%"width="50%" align="center"></br></br>
<b>For those looking for a good-looking VFM motorcycle with raw power – Pulsar NS200</b>
<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman">
The Pulsar NS200 is the naked twin of the stylish RS200. It is slightly low on power but the weight saving due to the absence of fairing makes it a very sporty motorcycle. It looks quite good and has that powerful streetfighter bike looks, all in a budget that is at least Rs 20,000 less than the RS200. If you want outright performance bike to challenge the likes of KTM and Yamaha, you should look no further.
